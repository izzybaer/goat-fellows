# Goat-Fellows RESTful API

## Overview

* This RESTful API provides the necessary back-end infrastructure and functionality to create, read, update and destroy data related to a goat rescue website.

* Currently, there is not a site that exists that allows people to become 'Guardians' (people able to provide services that help goats become rescued, get medical attention, and be fostered), and to add 'Goats' that need help of some sort. This site also provides people the ability to see other people who are Guardians in their city/state and see goats that need some kind of help in their city/state.

* There are a lot of websites in existence currently that are tied to one specific goat or animal rescue, and provide users the ability to donate, and volunteer at that rescue. There is no site that provides users all across the United States to connect with others in their location, and provide services to goats that need help in their location.

* The purpose of our API and supporting infrastructure is to encourage developers to create applications that provide value to all of the lives of animals in the United States without advocates or someone to stand for them. It also provides value to the lives of the vast number of people who care about animals and animal welfare.

# The Current Version (0.0.1)

* The current version of this program is designed to create, read, update, and destroy data that is used to add new users, add new guardians, and add new goats.

* This API is designed to be versatile so that anyone can become users, and then become guardians, and then add goats. Before anyone can add a goat they must first become a user and get a tokenSeed. Before anyone can become a guardian, they must first become a user. Before anyone can view guardians and view goats, they must first become a user.

# Future Releases

* V 1.0.0 scheduled to be released 9/25/2017 will include the following:

  * store and return detailed lists of specific people by location who can provide specific services.
  * store and return detailed lists of specific people by location.
  * store and return detailed lists of goats in need by location.
  * store and return detailed lists of goats who have been helped and provided for by specific people by location.
